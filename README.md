This repository contains the learning of GraphDB (such as neo4j/ Tibco Graph database

# Neo4J Notes:

* A graph database is an online database management system with CRUD operations working on a graph data model.
* Graph databases are generally built for use with online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. Accordingly, they are normally optimized for transactional performance, and engineered with transactional integrity and operational availability in mind.
* They are normally optimized for transactional performance, and engineered with transactional integrity and operational availability
* The biggest value that graphs bring to the development stack is their ability to store relationships and connections as first-class entities.
* Cypher is declarative query language (like SQL) to query graphDB
* GraphDB is used for:
  * Realtime recommendations for online retailers
  * Masterdata managment
  * Fraud Detection
  * Graph Based search
  * Network & IT operations
  * Identity & access managemnt
* A graph is composed of two elements: _nodes_ and _relationships_.
* nodes can have labels that are used to define types for nodes.
* A label can be used to group nodes of the same type.
* Each relationship represents how two nodes are connected. 
* A relationship represents the verb or action between two entities. 
* This general-purpose structure allows you to model all kinds of scenarios: from a system of roads, to a network of devices, to a populationâ€™s medical history, or anything else defined by relationships.
* You can add properties to nodes and relationships to further enrich the graph model.
